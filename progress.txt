[2026-01-14] #1 feat: add stock picture selection when creating rental items
- Files: schemas/index.ts, rental-item.ts, index.ts, rent-item-projection.ts, Inventory.tsx, ItemDetail.tsx, StockPicturePicker.tsx, stockPictures.ts, dev-server.ts, tests
- Changes: Added imageUrl field to domain state/events/actions, created compact StockPicturePicker (icon button with dropdown), 100 curated stock images with local search/filter by name and category
- Decisions: Local filtering instead of API (no config needed), picker positioned inline next to item name input, category chips for quick filtering
- Dev setup: Single dev server (dev-server.ts) integrates Vite middleware with Fastify - both API and frontend on port 3000 with HMR
- Issues: None
