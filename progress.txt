[2026-01-14] #1 feat: add stock picture selection when creating rental items
- Files: schemas/index.ts, rental-item.ts, index.ts, rent-item-projection.ts, Inventory.tsx, ItemDetail.tsx, StockPicturePicker.tsx, stockPictures.ts, dev-server.ts, tests
- Changes: Added imageUrl field to domain state/events/actions, created compact StockPicturePicker (icon button with dropdown), 100 curated stock images with local search/filter by name and category
- Decisions: Local filtering instead of API (no config needed), picker positioned inline next to item name input, category chips for quick filtering
- Dev setup: Single dev server (dev-server.ts) integrates Vite middleware with Fastify - both API and frontend on port 3000 with HMR
- Issues: None

[2026-01-26] #5 feat: move admin event log to dedicated tab with filtering
- Files: api/index.ts, Admin.tsx, EventLogTab.tsx, api.spec.ts
- Changes: Added getEventLog and getEventTypes tRPC endpoints with filtering (event names, date range, pagination). Created EventLogTab component with filter UI. Added tab navigation to Admin page.
- Decisions: Filter state in URL for shareable links, local filter state syncs on panel open to avoid cascading renders
- Issues: None
